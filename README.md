# braillePlus.  

This add-on aims to improve braillesupport in NVDA, by combining code from Attribra with my own code. 

# Features. 
The add-on adds the following features to NVDA: 
* Marks selected items with dots 7 and 8 and creates a checkbox in NVDA's braillesettings to turn on or off this feature. You can configure a keyboard-shortcut to do this as well. 
* Marks font attributes with dots 7 and 8, thanks to Attribra.  
See the full documentation (available in NVDA's add-on help feature) for further instructions on using the add-on.
